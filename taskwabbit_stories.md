            in there.

## Demo User

* As an unregistered, unauthorized and site testing user, I would like an easy way to log-in
    as a demo-user so I can access the functionality without having to sign-up:
    * I would like an easy to read and notice "Login as Demo-User" button that logs me in
        as a demo_user upon clicking the button.
        * This way I can easily log-in and test the site's features and functionality without
            needing to sign-up and enter credentials.
    * I would like the button to be on both the '/signup' and '/login' pages so I can easily
        notice it.


## Log Out

* If I'm a logged in user, I want to be able to log out via an easy to find log-out button on the
    navigation bar.
    * While on any page of the site:
        * I can log out of my account and be redirected to the homepage.
        * This way I can have peace of mind easily by quickly logging out to keep my information secure.

## Choose a Task

* If I'm a logged out user:
    * I should be able to access the search filter for my task I want done.
        * doing this should save the tasktype I want and redirect me to the sign-up login menu
        * If I decide to signup or login it should redirect me to the next part of the form
            and continue to create my task.

* If I'm a logged in user:
    * I should be able to access the search filter for my task I want done.
        * doing this should save the tasktype and get the form to fill out my tasks details.


## Task Details

* If I'm a logged out user:
    * I should only be able to access the form to create a task (task details) after signing up or logging in

* If I'm a logged in user:
    * I should be able to access the form to create a task through the "Choose a Task" search filter
    * I should be able to access and see the details about any previous tasks I have created

    * I would like the layout of the form to be easy to read and come in multiple steps so I
        don't get overwhelmed while trying to create my task.
        * I would like a bar at the top with 4 stopping points to let me know where I am
            in the form.
            * clicking on any of those stopping points should bring me to that part of the form
            * each stopping point should have a title for that part of the form so I can easily
                see where I am currently
            * once I finish one stopping point on the form I want to see a continue button that
                takes me to the next stopping point

            * once I reach the last stopping point I would like to see a Confirm button to let me know I am
                about to create this task

* upon submission of the form I would like to see my new task added to my list of tasks
